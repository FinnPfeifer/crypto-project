# Docker setup
**Note Must have Docker Installed to Run the Commands!**

## Building docker image
Run `start.sh`

## Restarting an existing container
Run `restart.sh`

## New Openssh or Openssl version
1. Remove the zip files for older version, and upload new version zip files.
2. Update docker file ARG names to respective zip file names

## Exploiting
Might have to install openssh-client via `apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server`
within the container (maybe can use openssh-portable.zip to install if
we can figure out where `configure` binary is from the `INSTALL` file
instructions in `openssh-portable`).

1. After both containers are up and running via `restart.sh` or `start.sh` script, get the ip address of the exploited container via `ip_addr.sh` in a third terminal outside docker.
2. Within the exploiter container:
```
cd openssh-portable
./ssh-exploit-driver.bash <IP-OF-DEBIAN-EXPLOITED>
```
