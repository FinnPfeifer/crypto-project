## Building docker image and starting container
Run `start.sh`

## Restarting an existing container
Run `restart.sh`

## New Openssh or Openssl version
1. Remove the zip files for older version, and upload new version zip files.
2. Update docker file ARG names to respective zip file names

## Generating key
Might have to install openssh-client via `apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server`
within the container (maybe can use openssh-portable.zip to install if
we can figure out where `configure` binary is from the `INSTALL` file
instructions in `openssh-portable`).
Then we can run the generate-key.sh script within the container.
